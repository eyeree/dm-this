# Day 1
## A fight over dinner
While eating dinner in a common room in town, a couple of young townfolk, Rolf and John, get into a fight. Turns out John found some ruins and wanted Rolf to go exploring with him but Rolf was scared off by stories of tombs with skeleton guards. Blageron helps calm things down, then decides to go with John to explore the ruins himself. Forth and Simone, who were also in the common room, join up with him and John and set out.

## Journey to the ruins
The party travels for a few hours through dense forest. Blageron keeps a watchful eye out for danger, his hand never far from his axe. As they near the ruins, the group is ambushed by three goblins. Blageron quickly positions himself between the attackers and his companions, raising his shield to protect them. He manages to defeat one goblin with a mighty swing of his axe, while his companions handle the other two.

## Making camp
After the ambush, the party decides to make camp outside the ruins, ready to adventure forth the next day. Blageron takes the first watch, sitting by the fire and keeping his axe close. He shares stories of his clan's mountain home with the others, speaking with pride of the great halls and forges they once maintained.

# Day 2
Blageron wakes early and prepares a simple breakfast for the party. When they discover the door that appeared to be an entry way to the ruins is a fake, he joins the search for another entrance. After a while, he notices a strange seam in the rock wall near the fake door and is able to pry at it with his dagger to reveal a hidden entrance. He volunteers to lead the way into the darkness, torch in one hand and axe in the other.
