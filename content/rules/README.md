# Rules Directory

This directory contains rule PDFs. The service will support multiple rule sets, and the rule set to be used is identified by the module.yaml file in the ./content/module/(module-id)/ folder.

## Structure

- **./content/rules/(rule-set-id)/** - contains rule PDFs for a specific rule set.

Place your rule PDFs in appropriately named subdirectories.
