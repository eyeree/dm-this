# Day 1
## The Party Meets
For various reasons, they all ended up in the same common room for dinner. When Rolf and John (NPCs) start fighting, Blageron and Forth (players) intervene, holding Rolf and John apart. Simone (player) gets Rolf and John to talk, describing what has them riled up. It seems Rolf had promised John some help in exploring an old ruin John found nearby. But now Rolf is backing out because he heard there were ancient skeletons guarding some tombs there. After some discussion, John agrees to show the party the location of the ruins as long has he gets a cut of anything they find there.

## Ambush on the way to the ruins
As the party nears the ruins, lead by John, they are ambushed by three goblins hiding in the underbrush. Blageron quickly moves to engage the closest goblin, while Forth and Simone ready their weapons. John cowers behind a tree. The battle is brief but fierce. Blageron cleaves one goblin with his axe, Forth shoots another with an arrow, and Simone finishes off the third with a well-placed dagger throw. After the battle, they search the goblins and find a crude map that seems to indicate a goblin camp not far from the ruins.

## Making camp
The party makes camp outside the ruins, ready to adventure forth the next day. They take turns keeping watch through the night. During Forth's watch, he hears strange whispers coming from the direction of the ruins, but sees nothing when he investigates.

# Day 2
The party discovers the door that appeared to be an entry way to the ruins is a fake. They search the area trying to find another way in. After a while, Blageron notices a strange seam in the rock wall near the fake door and is able to pry at it to reveal a hidden entrance. The party prepares to enter the ruins, lighting torches and readying weapons. John seems nervous but determined to follow.
